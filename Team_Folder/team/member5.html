  <p>Hey there! I am Bindu Lakshmanappa, but just call me Bindu. Originally from India, I am currently pursuing my masters degree at Hochschule Fulda in Germany, soaking in the best of both worlds—tech and travel. I discovered my passion for frontend during my internship, where I worked closely with the MERN stack. Among it all, React stood out—clear, component-based, and full of creative control. This semester, I am excited to collaborate with my team, build a solid web stack from the ground up, and create something that is not just functional but genuinely meaningful.</p>
